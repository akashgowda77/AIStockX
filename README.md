# 🧠 AI Scoring System

AIStockX introduces an intelligent scoring mechanism to compare prediction models.

Instead of comparing only one metric, the platform combines multiple evaluation metrics into a weighted AI Score.

| Metric              | Weight |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| Prediction Accuracy | 30%    |
| RMSE                | 20%    |
| MAE                 | 15%    |
| MAPE                | 10%    |
| Direction Accuracy  | 10%    |
| R² Score            | 10%    |
| Confidence Score    | 5%     |

This produces a realistic score that helps recommend the best-performing model.
